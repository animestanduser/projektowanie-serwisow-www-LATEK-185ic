                <p style="float: left"><br><strong>Dear Mr. Adam Johnson,</strong></p>
                
               
                <p style="padding-right:400px"><br><br><br><br>I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with your course I attended recently. The
                    knowledge provided by the instructors was very useful but other things about this course
                    disturbed me a lot.</p>
                    <p style="padding-right:400px">I must complain about the instructors. Most of them were very impatient. However, the
                    most memorable to me was an old man who had no respect for women. I think this is
                    unacceptable and you should do something about it.</p>
                    <p style="padding-right:400px">I was highly dissatisfied with my accommodation. There was information about a
                    four-star hotel in the advertisement, but my room was dirty and smelly. To make matters worse,
                    the air conditioning stopped working in the middle of the night. As a result, I had to ask for a
                    room change</p>
                    <p style="padding-right:400px">In the brochure I read about a variety of food. I am a vegetarian so of course I ordered
                    vegetarian catering. For all the days of the course, I was only provided with water and almost
                    raw vegetables.
                    </p>
                    <p style="padding-right:400px">I found the price I had to pay for this course outrageously high and I believe this
                    disappointment entitles me to compensation. I propose half the cost back or a free invitation to
                    the next First Aid course. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
